## To create a status badge for a GitHub workflow, follow the instructions below:

1. **Next**, go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository, where you will see a list of your workflows.

2. Click on the name of the workflow for which you want to create a status badge.

3. On the right side of the screen, you will see a **...** (three dots) button. Click on this button and select **Create status badge** from the dropdown menu.

4. You will see a Markdown code snippet that you can copy and paste into your README file or any other Markdown file in your repository.

Once you've added the badge code to your Markdown file, it will display the current status of your GitHub workflow, such as "passing" or "failing". The badge will also serve as a link to the GitHub Actions page for your workflow, allowing you to quickly view the details of your recent runs.
